## Implemented Tests

All tests have been implemented as required for the Nanodegree Project 6. 

Additionally, one further test suite has been implemented which tests if the color of the header changes when switching the feeds. Because this feature is not implemented yet, the test fails.


**NOTE:** I had to change the CSS class .menu to .side-menu so that the css doesn't interfere with the jasmine CSS
